| Method Category           | Cons                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Content-Based             | Requires creation of new cue sets for different contexts, limiting its generalizability across various misinformation topics and formats. Deep learning methods need extensive data and struggle with fake content crafted to closely resemble the truth.                                                               |
| Feedback-Based            | Heavily reliant on significant amounts of user response data, which may only become available at later stages of information propagation, potentially delaying the detection of misinformation.                                                                                                                         |
| Intervention-Based        | Resource-intensive, acting more as corrective measures after misinformation has spread, rather than preventive strategies. Assumes that fake news has already been identified and tracked, which is a complex prerequisite.                                                                                             |
| Identification Strategies | Network monitoring can be costly and requires frequent updates due to changing network dynamics. Crowd-sourcing is vulnerable to misuse and relies on the reliability of community feedback, which can vary. User behavior modeling assumes simplistic network structures, limiting applicability in complex scenarios. |

| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shift in News Consumption**           | - News consumption has shifted from traditional media to social media. <br>- Social media offers timeliness, cost-effectiveness, easier sharing, and interactive discussion, but often at lower quality.                                       |
| **Fake News and Challenges**            | - Fake news, designed to mislead, presents challenges to journalistic standards. <br>- It employs various linguistic styles and may misuse true evidence, making detection difficult.                                                          |
| **Time-critical Events and Fake News**  | - Fake news often correlates with events lacking corroborative evidence. <br>- This results in big, incomplete, and noisy data from user engagement.                                                                                           |
| **Defining Fake News**                  | - There's no consensus on a fake news definition, complicating detection. <br>- Social media amplifies fake news dissemination.                                                                                                                |
